# EPISURG

This is the code for the 3D Slicer extension EPISURG. The extension will be available in the Slicer extensions index soon. For now, you can clone this repo and [add the modules manually](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/FernandoPerezGarcia/vesseg/blob/86d70a88b13da5b9a7e312a836a68e9b84561bc6/vesseg/slicer/tutorial/segmentation-tutorial.md#add-module-shortcuts).

[EPISURG](https://doi.org/10.5522/04/9996158.v1) is a clinical dataset of T1-weighted MRI from 430 epileptic patients who underwent resective brain surgery at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery (Queen Square, London, United Kingdom) between 1990 and 2018.

The dataset comprises 430 postoperative MRI. The corresponding preoperative MRI is present for 268 subjects.

Three human raters segmented the resection cavity on partially overlapping subsets of EPISURG.

If you use this dataset for your research, you agree with the Data use agreement presented at the EPISURG entry on the UCL Research Data Repository and you must cite the corresponding publications listed on the EPISURG page: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/9996158.v1
